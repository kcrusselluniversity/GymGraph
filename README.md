## Project Purpose
I wanted to work on a larger scale, full stack project. I found the weight lifting tracking app I personally used didn't have the functionality and user experience I wanted, so I built one myself. 

A key focus I had for this project was to learn more about testing. I learnt a lot about good testing practices, when and what to test, and the different testing strategies including unit testing, integration testing and end-to-end (E2E) testing. I documented my lessons in the 'Lessons Learnt' section of this page.

Other key areas I wanted to focus on included project management (using Jira), folder management, and clean code practices (reusability/readability/maintainability etc).

I decided on using Firebase for the backend mainly for the simplicity and time saved by working with a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS). I initially considered building the backend with Django/Python, however realised it would take a significantly longer time to build compared to Firebase, and my focus for this project was to improve my frontend and testing skills.

## Future Features
With an application like this the opportunities for additional features are endless. Some of the keys things I would want to add include: 
- **Social Integration**: Functionality for users to connect with friends, share workouts, achievements, and potentially find workout partners.
- **Community and Support**: Forums or chat groups for users to discuss workouts, share tips, and offer support.
- **Gamification Elements**: Features like badges, challenges, and leaderboards to motivate users by making the process of lifting weights more engaging and competitive.
- **Personalised AI Recommendations**: Using AI to suggest personalised workouts and suggestions based on user data and progress.
